["SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites that are spread through sexual contact. These organisms can be found in vaginal fluids and in semen, on the skin of the genitals and areas around them, and in the mouth, throat, and rectum. Most STIs cause no symptoms or cause symptoms that can easily go unnoticed. Others can cause pain and physical and psychological discomfort. If not treated, some STIs can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and cervical Key Points for Providers and Clients "," People with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can use most family planning methods safely and effectively.  Male and female condoms can prevent STIs, including HIV, when used consistently and correctly.  STIs often have no signs or symptoms, particularly in women.  People should seek health care if they think that they or their partners might have an STI.  Many STIs can be successfully treated. The sooner they are treated, the less likely they are to cause long-term health problems such as infertility or chronic pain, or to infect a sexual partner or a fetus.  Vaginal discharge can also be caused by infections that are not sexually transmitted.  Cancer in women, and some STIs can cause infertility, and anorectal and prostate cancer in men. Some STIs can also greatly increase the chance of becoming infected with HIV. Who Is at Risk for STIs? Some family planning clients may be at high risk of getting an STI. A person’s risk of getting an STI, including HIV, depends on:  specific higher-risk behaviors (see the box below)  How common these infections are in the community. Family planning providers can help their clients assess their risk of getting an STI if they know how common or prevalent these infections are locally. Limited access to good-quality health services results in more untreated infections, which increases spread in the community. Understanding their own risk for HIV and other STIs helps people decide how to protect themselves and others. People are often the best judges of their own STI risk, ","especially when they are well informed about what behaviors and situations can increase or decrease the risk of infection Some groups (known as “key populations”) are at higher risk of HIV and other STIs, regardless of the prevalence in the general population. These include:  Adolescents  People who have sex for money, food, gifts, shelter, or favors  Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men  Transgender people  People who inject drugs  The sexual partners of these individuals. What Causes STIs? Several types of organisms cause STIs. Those caused by bacteria or parasites can generally be cured. STIs caused by viruses generally cannot be cured, although they can be treated to relieve or eliminate symptoms. Most STIs are spread by sexual activity, and much of this spread can be prevented by the correct and consistent use of condoms. Early Identification of STIs Ideally, an STI would be identified (and treated) early, to avoid complications and stop the spread of infection. To help detect STIs early, for every client seeking family planning, a provider should:  Ask about the client’s sexual history and assess their risk of getting an STI.  Ask whether the client or their partner(s) has symptoms of STIs, such as genital sores/pain/swelling, abnormal genital or anorectal discharge, or lower abdominal pain. "," Look for signs of STIs when doing a pelvic or genital examination.  For clients with signs and/or symptoms of STIs, promptly make a syndromic diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment, or in some settings perform STI testing as needed (rapid or laboratory testing, depending on availability—see next page) or refer the client to another facility for appropriate care.  For clients without STI signs or symptoms but who are at high risk for acquiring STIs, encourage them to get screened for syphilis and, when feasible, also for gonorrhea and chlamydia Choosing a Dual Protection Strategy Family planning providers can talk to clients about how they can protect themselves both from STIs, including HIV, and from pregnancy (known as “dual protection”). Strategy 1: Use male or female condoms consistently (with every sex act) and correctly  One method is used to help protect against both pregnancy and STIs. Strategy 2: Use male or female condoms consistently and correctly plus another family planning method  Using two methods provides extra protection from pregnancy in case the condom is not used, is used incorrectly, or breaks.  This strategy may be a good choice for those who want to feel reassured about avoiding pregnancy if they cannot always be sure of consistent and correct condom use. Strategy 3: If both partners know that they are not infected with any STIs, or if one partner is living with HIV but has achieved viral suppression through ART, then use any family planning method to prevent pregnancy and agree to stay in a mutually faithful relationship "," Many family planning clients believe they are in this group and thus feel protected from STIs, including HIV, without using condoms.  This strategy depends on good communication and trust between partners. Another dual protection strategy, which does not involve using condoms or any other contraceptives, is: Strategy 4: Engage only in sexual intimacy that avoids penetration or otherwise prevents semen and vaginal fluids from coming into contact with each other’s genitals or mouths (for example, mutual masturbation)  This strategy may not prevent syphilis, genital herpes, genital warts, or other infection with HPV, depending on the type of physical interaction that occurs. These STIs can be spread by skin-to-skin contact.  This strategy depends on good communication, trust, and self-control.  If this is the couple’s first-choice strategy, it is best to have condoms available in case penetrative sex occurs Many clients will need help, support, and guidance to make their dual protection strategy succeed. For example, they may need help preparing to talk with their partners about STI protection, learning how to use condoms and other methods of contraception, and handling practical matters such as where to get supplies and where to keep them. Providers unable to help with such matters should refer the client to someone who can provide more counseling or skills-building, such as role-playing to practice negotiating condom use.
