Effective starting 1 January 1978, it was retained after Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. The law expanded abortion access, permitting it under three circumstances. “No person may terminate a pregnancy otherwise than by this Act. Any person who contravenes subsection shall be guilty of an offense and liable to a fine not exceeding level ten or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.” Termination of Pregnancy Act No. 15 10 of the Republic of Zimbabwe of 1977 with amendments through 2001.
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:30px;">###</b>
<br></br>
Zimbabwe ranks as one of the countries with the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world, estimated 651 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. In contrast to a worldwide trend of decline, maternal mortality has increased in Zimbabwe over the past 25 years. 
</p>

 <p style="font-size:16px;text-align: left;" id="text"><u>Termination of pregnancy</u> Abortion is legally permitted in the country only under limited circumstances, including if the pregnant woman’s life is in danger or in cases of rape, incest, or fetal impairment. In practice, it is extremely difficult to obtain a legal abortion; as a result, most abortions are potentially unsafe.The Ministry of Health and Child Care of Zimbabwe has increased access to and improved post-abortion care to reduce maternal mortality. However, in such an effort to reduce the MMR the law still distracts the success, thus, empowerment of Adolescent Girls and Young Women with this law fuels informed decisions and capacitates them with advocacy skills for the amendment of this law.  
<br></br>
<br></br>
<B style="font-size:30px;">Increased access to Contraception </B>
<br></br>
In 2016, 40% of pregnancies in Zimbabwe were unintended and one-quarter of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
<br></br>
Recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Zimbabwe recorded a high-unmet need for family planning among young women aged 15–24 years. The most recent demographic health survey (DHS) data in 2015 showed that the unmet need for family planning among women of reproductive age (15–24 years) for unmarried young women was particularly high compared to married young women in the same age groups. 
<br></br>
Also called miscarriage, is a clinically recognized pregnancy loss before the 20th week of the pregnancy 
<br></br>

<b style="font-size:20px;">3.Incomplete abortion</b>
<br></br>
It is an abortion (spontaneous or induced) in which some pregnancy tissue passes out of the uterus but some of the tissue remains
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">4.Surgical abortion</b>
<br></br>
This type of abortion is a use of transcervical procedures for terminating pregnancy, including vacuum aspiration and dilatation and evacuation
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">5.Vacuum abortion</b>
<br></br>
It is a use of a suction device (e.g. a syringe) to remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus, commonly performed before the 12th week of gestation, either manual or electric.
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:25px;font-family:sans-serif;">Unsafe Abortion</b>
<br></br>
When not managed by a medical professional, abortion is a risky and costly procedure. When abortion was illegal, individuals resorted to illegal means of attaining it. These included but were not limited to foreign bodies placed in the uterus through the cervix, such as sticks dipped in oil, wire, knitting needles, coat hangers, ballpoint pens, and air blown in by either a syringe or turkey baster. While illegal abortions carry inherent risks, as per the World Health Organization (WHO), the main causes of death from unsafe abortion are hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, genital trauma, and necrotic bowel 
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:25px;">Pain Management as Human Right during Abortions</b>
<br></br>
The ethical responsibility of clinicians to manage pain is well understood and a basic element of ethical codes. For instance, the American Medical Association states that “Physicians have an obligation to relieve pain and suffering, “and the World Health Assembly resolved that “It is an ethical duty of healthcare professionals to alleviate pain and suffering. “In response to the major gaps in treatment, pain and palliative care professional associations went further and made a series of declarations asserting that pain management and palliative care are basic human rights. (A summary of those statements is presented in the box ‘International Statements Articulating Pain Management or Palliative Care as Human Rights and Their Sponsoring Organizations). Although there may be a moral obligation to manage pain, there is a basis for a right to treatment of pain in human rights law.
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:29px;">Economic and Social Cost of Unsafe Abortion</b>
<br></br>

<br></br>
<b  style="font-size:23px;">Financial impact of abortion</b> 
<br></br>
In United States of America, the cost of treating a septic patient can go as high as $51,000 per case. Factoring in that a total of 629,898 legal abortions were reported to CDC from 48 reporting areas in 2019, even if a fifth of these women had attempted an illegal abortion for whichever reason and subsequently developed the due complications; it would have cost upwards of 6.4 billion dollars to attempt saving the lives of these women in 2019 alone. In addition to sepsis, hemorrhage, uterine perforation, and internal organ damage, all of which are medical emergencies, are likely complications of illegal abortion that carry a heavy management cost and often end in the patient’s death. From a financial perspective, the cost of caring for uninsured patients falls on hospitals and taxpayers.
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:23px;">Legal versus illegal abortion </b>
<br></br>
It is a fact that abortion, the documentation of which can be traced back to 2700 BC, is a fundamental part of human history; making it illegal is unlikely to make it go away. Even in the modern day, the incidence of securing an abortion in countries that restrict abortion and those with more liberal access is interestingly equivalent. As per the CDC, the incidence of abortion is 11.4 per 1000 women in the US alone. According to data from statistical studies, the legality of abortion across the world has little to no effect on abortion rates worldwide. Legal or not, abortions can, will, and do take place. The legality of abortion, however, does affect how safe those abortions are.
<br></br>
While many women may abort because of their current circumstances, they often proceed to want to have children upon the improvement of said circumstances; the medical complications of an illegal abortion are likely to place the patient in a position where even if they wanted to have children, they would be physically unable to; or at the very least, the risk of pregnancy would be immeasurably fatally dangerous to both mother and fetus. Worldwide, an estimated 68,000 women (eight/hour) die from an illegal abortion. This translates to a case-fatality rate of 367/100,000, which is hundreds of times greater than legal abortions. In essence, abortions will happen, whether they are legal or not. Illegal abortions, however, carry a much heavier toll, both medically and financially, as compared to legal ones.

 <b style="font-size:20px;">What is second trimester abortions?</b>
 <br></br>
 Second trimester abortion is an issue that is not only controversial in political terms but also has legal implications, and health implications that go beyond beliefs and personal politics.
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">Dilation and Evacuation (D&E)</b>
<br></br>
At this point in pregnancy, the fetus’s body is too large to be broken up by suction and will not pass through the suction tubing. The cervix (the opening to the uterus) must be more dilated (opened) than in a first-trimester abortion. This is usually accomplished by inserting laminaria (a porous material which expands with moisture in order to open and soften the cervix) a day or two before the abortion. The physician then dilates the cervix and dismembers the body and crushes the skull to facilitate removal.
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">Risks and Considerations for D&E</b>
<br></br>
If the cervix is not dilated enough from the laminaria then it will be manually opened using metal dilating rods. There is a possibility that the cervix may be cut, torn, or damaged, resulting in excessive bleeding that requires surgical repair.
<br></br>
Most women experience some pain that will require a pain-killer either locally by shots in the area of the cervix or, on rare occasions, by general anesthesia.
<br></br>
 <a style="margin-left:27px;">• Complications from general anesthesia used during abortion surgery may result in convulsions, heart attack, and in extreme cases, death. It also increases the risk of other serious complications.Up to 16 weeks, the procedure involves primarily the aspiration technique where the fetus is suctioned out of the uterus. Any remaining fetal parts are removed with forceps and, if necessary, a curette to scrape out any remaining tissue.</a>
<br></br>
 <a style="margin-left:27px;">• Scarring of the uterine lining can occur by the abortion instruments that may result in miscarriages in consecutive future pregnancies and possible infertility.</a>
 <br></br>
 <a style="margin-left:27px;">• There is a risk that the uterus and nearby organs (like the bladder) may be punctured or torn by the abortion instruments. Perforation of the uterus may result in surgery that could include removal of the uterus (hysterectomy). These two bullet points are from above paragraphs.</a>
<br></br>
Complications resulting in a damaged cervix and/or perforated uterus are rare but be sure to contact your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms:
<br></br>
<a style="margin-left:27px;">• Heavy or prolonged bleeding or blood clots.</a>
<br></br>
 <a style="margin-left:27px;">• Fever</a>
 <br></br>
 <a style="margin-left:27px;">• Pain</a>
<br></br>
 <a style="margin-left:27px;">• Abdominal Tenderness</a>
<br></br>
 <a style="margin-left:27px;">• Foul-smelling discharge from the vagina</a>
<br></br>
After 16 weeks, much of the procedure is performed using forceps to remove the fetus in pieces due to the fetus’ size. The doctor keeps track of all fetal body parts to ensure none are left inside. A curette and suction are used to remove any remaining tissue or blood clots, since they can cause infection and bleeding if left inside.
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">Legal Implications</b>
<br></br>
Abortions performed in the second trimester vary in terms of legality. While abortions are legal in some parts of the world until before the end of the second trimester (in the United States abortions performed in the first and second trimester are legal up to 24 weeks), in other parts of the world only first trimester abortions are legal.
<br></br>
In Zimbabwe it I illegal to perform abortion either safe or unsafe according to the Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1977. The Termination of Pregnancy Act is a law in Zimbabwe governing abortion. Enacted in 1977 by the Parliament of Rhodesia and effective starting 1 January 1978, it was retained after Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.The law expanded abortion access, permitting it under three circumstances: if the pregnancy endangers the life of the woman or threatens to permanently impair her physical health, if the child may be born with serious physical or mental defects, or if the fetus was conceived as a result of rape or incest.
<br></br>
An abortion may only be performed by a medical practitioner in an institution designated by the Ministry of Health and Child Care, with the written permission of the hospital superintendent or administrator. In order for the abortion procedure to be performed, two medical practitioners who are not from the same medical partnership or institution must certify that the requisite conditions indeed exist. In cases of unlawful intercourse, (rape, incest, or intercourse with a mentally handicapped woman), a court magistrate of the jurisdiction in which the abortion would take place must issue a certificate certifying that the pregnancy was probably that the result of unlawful intercourse as defined in the Act. Abortion services are provided by the Ministry of Health and Child Care, and are free to low-income and unemployed women
<br></br>
Illegal abortion carries a penalty of imprisonment up to five years and/or a fine. The Termination of Pregnancy Act set the fine at Z$5,000.However, Zimbabwe no longer uses the Zimbabwean dollar. Under section 60 of the Criminal Law and Codification Reform Act, illegal abortion is punishable by up to five years in prison and/or a fine not exceeding level 10.
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">What Is Incomplete Abortions?</b>
<br></br>
An incomplete abortion is a subtype of spontaneous abortion, along with inevitable and missed abortion. Other types of spontaneous abortion are threatened abortion and complete abortion. This article will focus on incomplete abortion, which is described as partial loss of products of conception within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Patients will present with vaginal bleeding with lower abdominal and/or pain and cramping. Threatened abortion is vaginal bleeding with a closed cervical os and viable pregnancy. Inevitable abortion is vaginal bleeding with an open cervical os and viable pregnancy. Complete abortion is vaginal bleeding with either an open or closed cervical or with complete loss of products of conception.
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">Who Can Provide Safe Abortion?</b>
<br></br>
Abortions are safe when they are carried out with a method that is recommended by WHO and that is appropriate to the pregnancy duration, and when the person carrying out the abortion has the necessary skills.
<br></br>
In addition to non-specialist and specialist doctors, a wide range of health worker cadres – such as auxiliary nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives, nurses, midwives, associate/ advanced associate clinicians, pharmacists and doctors of complementary medicine – can provide various aspects of medical abortion services.
<br></br>
YES a medical abortion be self-managed by the client herself. This is when using the combination mifepristone and misoprostol regimen, the medical abortion process can be self-managed for pregnancies up to 12 weeks of gestation, including the ability to take the medications at home, without direct supervision of a health-care provider.
<br></br>
<b style="font-size:20px;">What is Post Abortion Care?</b>
<br></br>
The WHO outlines the key clinical examinations, treatment and care that should be provided to a woman who has experienced bleeding in early pregnancy or an abortion. It includes curative care, such as treating abortion complications, as well as preventative care, such as providing birth control to prevent future unwanted pregnancies. Post-abortion care reduces morbidity and mortality associated with abortion.
<br></br> 
The curative care aspect of PAC includes treating incomplete abortions by removing any fetal or maternal tissues remaining in the uterus. This can include using vacuum aspiration (suction) or curettage (scraping). Aspiration results in shorter procedure times, less pain, and less blood loss than curettage. The drug misoprostol is an alternative to manual removal and is another option for treating incomplete abortion.
<br></br>
For preventative care, women are provided family planning counseling and services, as most women seeking PAC were not using modern contraceptives at the time of conception. A study in Zimbabwe found that family planning counseling was associated with a significant reduction in unwanted pregnancies and repeat abortions in the year after they received post-abortion care. Infrequently, sexual health screenings such as HIV testing are provided as part of post-abortion care, though sexually transmitted infection screening is low and has been identified as an unmet need of PAC.
